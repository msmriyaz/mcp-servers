# Product Context: Weather Anywhere MCP

## Purpose
Weather Anywhere MCP serves as an integration between Claude and real-time global weather data. It enables Claude to respond to user queries about weather conditions anywhere in the world, enhancing Claude's capabilities with external, up-to-date information.

## Problem Solved
1. **Information Access Gap**: Without this integration, Claude would lack access to current weather data, limiting its ability to answer weather-related queries.
2. **Real-time Data Need**: Users often want current weather information during conversations without switching applications.
3. **Global Coverage Requirement**: Users need weather information for any location worldwide, not just limited regions.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Natural Interaction**: Users should be able to ask about weather in natural language without special syntax.
2. **Seamless Integration**: Weather information should appear as part of Claude's responses without obvious context switching.
3. **Comprehensive Data**: Responses should include relevant weather details (temperature, conditions, wind, etc.).
4. **Global Coverage**: System should work for any location worldwide that users might inquire about.

## Intended Workflow
1. User asks Claude a weather-related question (e.g., "What's the weather in Paris right now?")
2. Claude identifies this as a weather query and uses the appropriate Weather MCP tool
3. The Weather MCP server queries OpenWeatherMap API with the relevant parameters
4. Data is formatted and returned to Claude
5. Claude incorporates this information into its response to the user

## Key Value Propositions
1. **Expanded Capabilities**: Adds real-world, real-time data to Claude's knowledge
2. **Convenience**: Users get weather information without leaving their conversation
3. **Flexibility**: Supports various weather information needs (current conditions, forecasts, alerts)
4. **Global Reach**: Works for any location covered by OpenWeatherMap (virtually worldwide)

## User Personas
1. **Casual User**: Wants simple weather updates during conversation
2. **Travel Planner**: Needs forecast information for trip planning
3. **Weather-Dependent Professional**: Requires specific weather details for work decisions
4. **Safety-Conscious Individual**: Checks for weather alerts in areas of interest

## Success Measures
1. **Accuracy**: Weather information matches official sources
2. **Response Time**: Information is retrieved and presented quickly
3. **Comprehensiveness**: All requested weather details are provided
4. **User Satisfaction**: Users find the weather information helpful and convenient
