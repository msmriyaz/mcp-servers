# Weather Anywhere MCP: TypeScript Implementation

## Project Definition
A TypeScript implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides global weather data to Claude desktop. This server integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to allow Claude to access current weather conditions, forecasts, and weather alerts for any location worldwide.

## Core Requirements
1. Provide a reliable MCP server implementation for weather data
2. Enable Claude to access global weather information through natural language queries
3. Support various weather data endpoints including current conditions, forecasts, and alerts
4. Maintain a clean, typed TypeScript implementation for maintainability
5. Ensure proper error handling for API failures or configuration issues

## Technical Stack
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDK

## Project Scope
- Implementation of three MCP tools: get-weather, get-forecast, and get-alerts
- Support for both metric and imperial units
- Error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Clear documentation for setup and usage
- No UI component (this is a backend service for Claude)

## Out of Scope
- Weather visualization or graphical representations
- Historical weather data beyond the current API capabilities
- User authentication or multi-user support
- Advanced caching mechanisms

## Success Criteria
- Claude can successfully retrieve current weather for any city globally
- Claude can get multi-day forecasts for any coordinates
- Claude can check for weather alerts at specific locations
- The server starts and operates reliably
- Setup process is straightforward with clear documentation
