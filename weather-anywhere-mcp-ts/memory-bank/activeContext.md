# Active Context: Weather Anywhere MCP

## Current Focus
The current focus for the Weather Anywhere MCP project is ensuring the stable operation of the core weather tools and improving error handling. The project has implemented the three required tools (get-weather, get-forecast, get-alerts) and currently offers a functional MCP server for weather data access.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented the OpenWeatherMap API integration
- Created three MCP tools for different weather data needs
- Added proper error handling for API failures
- Set up environment variable configuration
- Configured proper unit formatting (metric/imperial)

## Active Decisions
1. **API Provider**: OpenWeatherMap was chosen as the data provider due to its:
   - Global coverage
   - Reliable API
   - Free tier availability
   - Comprehensive data offerings

2. **Tool Design**: The three separate tools approach was chosen over a single generic tool to:
   - Provide clearer parameter validation
   - Enable more specific responses
   - Allow for tailored formatting per query type
   - Simplify Claude's tool selection process

3. **Response Format**: Text-only responses were chosen for simplicity and compatibility, though image-based weather visualization could be considered in the future.

## Current Challenges
1. **API Rate Limiting**: The free OpenWeatherMap tier has rate limits that could affect high-usage scenarios.
2. **Geolocation**: The system relies on the user knowing city names or coordinates; it doesn't have geolocation capabilities.
3. **Error Handling**: While basic error handling is in place, edge cases (like incomplete API responses) could be improved.

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all tools with various input scenarios
2. **Documentation**: Complete user documentation with example queries
3. **Potential Enhancements**:
   - Add caching to reduce API calls for repeated requests
   - Improve error messages with more specific troubleshooting suggestions
   - Consider adding a geocoding capability for more flexible location specification
