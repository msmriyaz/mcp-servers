## In Progress Features
- 🔄 Comprehensive testing across different locations and query patterns
- 🔄 Edge case error handling improvements
- 🔄 Documentation refinements

## Planned Features
- ⏳ Caching mechanism for repeated requests
- ⏳ Geocoding capability for more flexible location queries
- ⏳ Enhanced logging for debugging
- ⏳ Metrics collection for usage patterns

## Known Issues
1. **API Rate Limiting**: May hit rate limits with frequent queries
2. **Location Flexibility**: Users need to know exact city names or coordinates
3. **Error Verbosity**: Some error messages could be more helpful

## Next Development Priorities
1. Improve test coverage
2. Enhance error handling for edge cases
3. Consider implementing basic caching
4. Add more detailed usage examples to documentation

## Overall Status
The Weather Anywhere MCP is **feature complete** for the core requirements. It provides the three main weather data tools as specified, handles errors gracefully, and includes comprehensive documentation for setup and usage. Current focus is on refinement and quality improvements rather than new feature development.
